      My name is Johannes Svanborg, and I am a 27-year-old self-taught full stack developer from Sweden. I currently work at TietoEvry as a cloud developer, where I use my skills in React, JavaScript, and Python for frontend development, as well as Powershell, Terraform, Azure Functions and Different Azure Databases for backend work.
<br/>
I've always been passionate about technology and coding, and I've spent countless hours learning and practicing on my own. Over time, I've honed my skills and developed a deep understanding of the web development process.

Whether you're looking for someone to develop your website, create a custom application, or tackle any other coding challenge, I am confident that I have the skills and expertise to help.
